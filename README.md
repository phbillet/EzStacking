<h1 style="text-align: center;">EzStacking: from data to Kubernetes thru Scikit-Learn, Keras, FastAPI and Docker</h1>

# Introduction
EzStacking is a [**development tool**](#ezstacking---as-development-tool) designed to adress [**supervised learning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) problems. 

EzStacking handles **classification**, **regression** and **time series forecasting** problems for **structured data** (_cf. Notes hereafter_) using [**stacked generalization**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#stacking), that is an ensemble learning approach that trains a **level 1 model** to integrate the predictions of multiple **level 0 models**, with the aim of generating more robust and precise predictions than any of the individual base models.

Sometimes, the stacked models can be heavy, slow or not accurate, they can contain bad level 0 models or some features have bad influence on score, EzStacking allows the **final model** to be **optimised** along three axes:
- the number of **features** (reduced using feature importance)
- the number of **level 0 models** (reduced using model importance)
- the **complexity** (depth) of the level 0 models (depending on the user's choices).

The main principles used in EzStacking are also presented in these two articles:
- [Model stacking to improve prediction and variable importance robustness for soft sensor development](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772508122000254) Maxwell Barton, Barry Lennox - Digital Chemical Engineering Volume 3, June 2022
- [Stacking with Neural network for Cryptocurrency investment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07855v1.pdf) Avinash Barnwal, Haripad Bharti, Aasim Ali, and Vishal Singh - Inncretech Inc., Princeton, February 2019.

The **development process** produces:
* a development notebook (generated by a **[Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) generator** based on  [**Scikit-Learn pipelines**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html#combining-estimators) and [**stacked generalization**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#stacking)) containing: 
  * an [**exploratory data analysis (EDA)**](#data-quality--eda) used to assess data quality
  * a [**modeling**](#modeling) [building](#build) a reduced-size stacked estimator, including at each step an evaluation and an inspection of the model
* a [**server**](#serving-the-model) (with its client) returning a prediction, a measure of the quality of input data and the execution time
* a [**test generator**](#test) that can be used to evaluate server performance
* a [**Docker container generator**](#docker) that contains all the necessary files to build the final Docker container based on FastAPI and uvicorn, and a file for the deployment of the API in Kubernetes
* a [**zip package**](#zip--clean) containing all the files produced during the process.

_Notes:_ 
* _the **time series forecasting** problem is based on the **transformation** of **time series** to **supervised learning problem**_
* _EzStacking **must** be used with *.csv dataset using separator ','_  
* _the column names **must not** contain spaces (otherwise it will produce error during server generation)_
* _for the **time series** forecasting, one of the columns in the dataset must be a **temporal value**._

# EzStacking - How to install it
First you have to:
* install [**Anaconda**](https://anaconda.org/) 
* create the **virtual environment** EzStacking using the following command: `conda env create -f ezstacking.yaml`
* **activate** the virtual environment using the following command: `conda activate ezstacking`
* **install kernel** in ipython using the following command: `ipython kernel install --user --name=ezstacking`
* launch the **Jupyter server** using the following command: `jupyter-lab --no-browser`

_Note: `jupyter-lab` is a comfortable development tool more flexible than `jupyter notebook`._  

### How to uninstall it
You simply have to: 
* **deactivate** the virtual environment using the following command: `conda deactivate`
* **remove the virtual environment** using the following command: `conda remove --name ezstacking --all`  
* **remove the kernel** using the following command: `jupyter kernelspec uninstall ezstacking`

# EzStacking - How to use it

## Input file and problem characteristics

In Jupyter, first open the notebook named `ezstacking.ipynb`:

![First launch](./screenshots/EZStacking_first_launch.png)

Then click on `Run All Cells`:

![ezstacking GUI](./screenshots/EZStacking_gui.png)

First select your **file**, then select the **target** name (_i.e._ the variable on which we want to make predictions), the **problem type** (_i.e._ **classification** if the target is **discrete**, **regression** if the target is **continous**, if the problem is **time dependent**, the **time indexing column** and the **lag number** must be filled) and the **data size**:

![ezstacking GUI](./screenshots/EZStacking_file_selection.png)

![EZStacking GUI_ts](./screenshots/EZStacking_ts.png)

_Notes:_ 
* _the data size is **small**, if the number of row is smaller than **3000**_
* _the **lag number** is the number of past observations used to train the model_
* _**Random seed** is used for **replicability**._
## Development
Now, let's choose the options:

* _the visualisation option Seaborn can produce time consuming graphics._

#### Thresholds in EDA
![ezstacking Thresholds EDA](./screenshots/EZStacking_thresholds_eda.png)

_Notes:_
* _threshold_cat: if the **number of different values** in a column is less than this number, the column will be considered as a **categorical column**_
* _threshold_NaN: if the proportion of **NaN** is greater than this number the column will be **dropped**_
* _threshold_Z: if the **Z_score**  (indicating **outliers**) is greater than this number, the row will be **dropped**._


### Splitting

![ezstacking Splitting](./screenshots/EZStacking_thresholds_split.png)

_Notes:_
* _test size: **proportion** of the dataset to include in the test split_
* _threshold_E: if **target entropy** is greater than this number, **[RepeatedStratifiedKFold](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#repeated-k-fold)** will be used._
* _if the option **Undersampling** is checked, then an [undersampler](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/under_sampling.html) must be chosen with care._

### Modeling
![ezstacking Modeling](./screenshots/EZStacking_modeling.png) 


|Model	|Data size | |Model |Data size |
|------|----------|-|------|----------|
|[Gradient Boosting](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#id36)	|both | |[SGD](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#stochastic-gradient-descent-sgd)	|both |

|[Histogram-based Gradient Boosting](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#histogram-based-gradient-boosting)|both |

_Notes:_
* _if the option "**No correlation**" is checked, the model will not integrate decorrelation step_
* _if the option "**No model optimization**" is checked, the number of models and of features will not be reduced automatically_
* _if **no estimator** is selected, the **regressions** (resp. **classifications**) will use **linear regressions** (resp. **logistic regressions**)_
* _depending on the **data size**, EzStacking uses the estimators given in the preceding table for the level 0_
* _estimators based on **Keras** or on **Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting** benefit from [**early stopping**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping), those based on gaussian processes do not benefit from it_
* _the Gaussian methos option is only available for small dataset._ 

_**Known bugs** using Keras:_
* _for **classification problems**: the generated **API doesn't work** with Keras_
* _the **ReduceLROnPlateau** callback produces an error when **saving the model**._

#### Level 1 model options
|Option                   | Notes                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
|Level 1 model type       | Regression (linear or logistic) or decision tree        |


#### Thresholds in modeling

_Notes:_
* _threshold_corr: if the **correlation** is greater than this number the column will be **dropped**_
* _threshold_score:  **keep** models having **test score** greater than this number._
* _threshold_model: **keep** this number of **best models** (in the sens of **model importance**)_
* _threshold_feature: **keep** this number of **most important features**_

### Build
Simply enter a file name:

![ezstacking output](./screenshots/EZStacking_build.png)

Just click on the button ![ezstacking generate](./screenshots/EZStacking_generate.png), you should find **your notebook** in the **current folder** (otherwise a Python error will be emitted).

Then open the notebook, and click on the button `Run All Cells`.

## Test
![ezstacking Output](./screenshots/EZStacking_test.png)

You just have to fill the numbers of (passing and non-passing) tests. Then click on the button ![ezstacking generate tests](./screenshots/EZStacking_generate_tests.png), it will generate the file `test.sh`.

Now, at the bottom of the generated notebook, click on the link ![ezstacking link](./screenshots/EZStacking_link.png).

It opens the server notebook, then execute the line `run server.py` (and check carfully if the server is well started). If you have chosen the link http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs it opens the classical test gui of FastAPI.

If you have clicked on the link [client](client), it opens the client notebook and you just have to execute the first command, the result should look like the following:
![ezstacking Tests_exec](./screenshots/EZStacking_test_exec.png)

## Docker

[**Docker Desktop**](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is the tool used for this part.

The last step of the main notebook is the generation of all the useful files used to build the Docker container associated with the model.

These files are stored in a folder having the name of the project.

Open a terminal in this folder and launch the following command to **build** the container:
* `docker build -t <project_name> .`

The container can be **run** directly in Docker Desktop, you can also use the following command line:
* `docker run --rm -p 80:80 <project_name>`

_**Note**:_ 
* _**Models using Keras** will **not work** due to technical problem with SciKeras_

### Kubernetes
The program also generates a file for the API deployment in Kubernetes:

**Deployment** in Kubernetes:
* `kubectl apply -f <project_name>_deployment.yaml`

**Control** the deployment of the service:
* `kubectl get svc`

**Delete** the service:
* `kubectl delete -f <project_name>_deployment.yaml`

_**Note**:_ 
* _The generated test script can be used with both Docker and kubernetes._
* _If the container is **running in Docker**, it must be **stopped** before **testing** it in **Kubernetes**._

## Zip & Clean
![ezstacking output](./screenshots/EZStacking_zip_clean.png)

If you click on the button ![ezstacking Zip](./screenshots/EZStacking_zip.png), EzStacking generates a zip archive file containing:
* the initial dataset
* the developement notebook
* the model
* the data schema
* the client and the server
* a generic notebook to test FastAPI endpoint.

Further more, it also suppresses from the folder the elements added to the archive, the **files generated for the Docker container** are **simply deleted** (it is assumed that the container had been built in Docker). 

_Note: it is advisable to close properly the generated notebooks (`Ctrl + Shift + Q`)._

# EzStacking - As development tool
## Development process
Once the first notebook has been generated, the development process can be launched.

You simply have to follows the following workflow:

<img src="./screenshots/EZStacking_development_process.png" data-canonical-src="./screenshots/EZStacking_development_process.png" width="50%" height="50%" />

Fortunately, if the option "**No model optimization**" is not checked in the modeling step, the entire process is automated, you just have to fix the thresholds.

## Data quality & EDA
EDA can be seen as a **toolbox** to evaluate **data quality** like: 
* dataframe **statistics**
* **cleaning** _i.e._ **NaN** and **outlier** dropping
* ranking / **correlation** 

_Note: the EDA step **doest not** modify data, it just indicates which actions should be done._

This process returns:
* a **data schema** _i.e._ a description of the input data with data type and associated domain: 
  * minimum and maximum for **continous features**, 
  * a list for **categorical features**
* a list of columns `dropped_cols` that should be **suppressed** (simply adding at the departure of the EDA this list to the variable `user_drop_cols`, then it is necessary to **re-launch** from the EDA). 

_Notes:_
* _Tip: starting with the end of the EDA is a good idea (`Run All Above Selected Cell`), so you do not execute unnecessary code (at the first step of development)_
* _[Yellow Brick](https://www.scikit-yb.org) offers different graphs associated to ranking and correlation and many more informations_
* _The main steps of data **pre-processing**:_
  1. _not all estimators support **NaN** : they must be corrected using **iterative imputation** (resp. **simple imputation**) for numerical features (resp. categorical features)._
  2. _data **normalization** and **encoding** are also key points for successful learning_ 
  3. _only the **correlations** with the target are interesting, the others must be removed (for linear algebra reasons)_
* _Those steps are implemented in the first part of the **modeling pipeline**._

## Modeling
### Model construction

The **first step** of modeling is structured as follow:

<img src="./screenshots/EZStacking_initial_model.png" data-canonical-src="./screenshots/EZStacking_initial_model.png" width="50%" height="50%" />

During the splitting step: 
* if the dataset is large, the test set should be reduced to 10% of the whole dataset
* imbalanced classes are measured using [Shannon entropy](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/239973/a-general-measure-of-data-set-imbalance), if the score is too low, the splitting is realized using [RepeatedStratifiedKFold](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#repeated-k-fold).

_Note: for **imbalanced class management**, EZStacking also offers different **subsampling methods** as an option._

This initial model is maybe too large, the modeling process **reduces** its size in terms of **models** and **features** as follow:
1. the set of **estimators** is reduced according to the **test scores** and the **importance** of each level 0 models

|Regression test scores  |  Classification test scores |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
|![](./screenshots/EZStacking_test_score_regre.png)  |  ![](./screenshots/EZStacking_test_score_classi.png)|

|Regression model importance  |  Classification model importance |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
|![](./screenshots/EZStacking_mod_imp_regre.png)  |  ![](./screenshots/EZStacking_mod_imp_classi.png)|

2. the reduced estimator is trained 
3. the **feature importance** graphic indicates which columns could also be **dropped**

|Regression feature importance  |  Classification feature importance |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
|![](./screenshots/EZStacking_feat_imp_regre.png)  |  ![](./screenshots/EZStacking_feat_imp_classi.png)|

4. those columns are added to the variable `dropped_cols` depending on the value of `threshold_feature`
5. `dropped_cols` can be added to `user_drop_cols` at the departure of the EDA (then it is necessary to **re-launch** from the EDA).

_Notes:_ 
* _the calculation of the **model importance** is based on the coefficients of the regularized linear regression used as level 1 estimator_
* _the **feature importance** is computed using [permutation importance](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/permutation_importance.html)_
* _it is important not to be too stingy, it is not necessary to remove too many estimators and features, as this can lead to a decrease in performance._

## Serving the model
EzStacking also generates an API based on [**FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

The complete **development process** produces three objects:
* a **schema**
* a **model**
* a **server** source.

They can be used as basic **prediction service** returning:
* a **prediction** 
* a list of columns in **error** (_i.e._ the value does not belong to the domain given in the schema)
* the elapsed and CPU **times**.

Example: 
Regression with data drift |  Classification without data drift
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](./screenshots/EZStacking_server_response.png)  |  ![](./screenshots/EZStacking_server_response_OK.png)

## Testing the model
The **schema** is also used to build the file of **passing** and **non-passing tests**, indeed a passing test (resp. a non-passing test) means that all features belong to their domains given in the schema (resp. at least one feature does not belong to its domain).

As we have already seen, the server returns the consumption of each request, in the test phase we also have access to the **global consumption** linked to the execution of all requests.

A test file for **Docker** (and **Kubernetes**) is also created, it is located in the directory associated with the Docker container.

# Some results
I spent some time on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/philippebillet/code), some results about the optimisation process described here are given in this site, moreover and analysis of the results can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/philippebillet/stacking-importances-result-analysis). 
I became Nobebooks Master with this project.

Time has passed and EzStacking continues to evolve, some full projects (in zip format) can be found in the `example` folder on [GitHub](https://github.com/phbillet/EzStacking).
